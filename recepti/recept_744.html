Navy Bean Soup</h2>
<p>Bacon makes everything better (in my opinion), especially in this Navy Bean Soup. I love soups with beans such as this <a href="https://www.skinnytaste.com/16-bean-soup-with-ham-and-kale/" rel="">16 Bean Soup</a>, and this <a href="https://www.skinnytaste.com/pasta-fagioli-64-pts/" rel="">Pasta Fagiole</a>. I made this in my <a href="https://amzn.to/2MmLLmG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Instant Pot</a> (<em>affil link</em>), which is a slow cooker, electric pressure cooker, rice cooker, steamer, yogurt maker in one, but I&#8217;ve also included slow cooker and stove top directions as well.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a slight chill in the air this week which is putting me in soup mode. It&#8217;s also putting me in curl up with a book mode with a cozy throw while dinner is simmering in the kitchen – do you feel me?  This soup, it&#8217;s perfect for this cooler weather and uses pantry staples such as canned beans and broth. If you don&#8217;t eat pork, turkey bacon would be great here too. Now that beans are zero Smart Points on the new Weight Watchers Freestyle Plan, I&#8217;ve been making beans and legume dishes more often.</p>
<h2>How To Make Navy Bean Soup</h2>
<div class="video-container"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Navy Bean Soup Recipe" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kgReXRiBFtU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<h2>Cooking Tips:</h2>
<p>To thicken the soup I pureed 1 can of beans with water before cooking, then once it was cooked I pureed 2 cups of the cooked soup and mixed it all together leaving the rest a little chunky. I am labeling this kid-friendly because I would have eaten this as a kid, but full disclosure my youngest daughter Madison does not like beans or anything pureed (kids!) but Karina my oldest does. If your kids like beans, they will love this soup.</p>

<p>And since so many are asking, although I have and love my <a href="https://amzn.to/2EppKBr" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Instant Pot</a>, I still love my slow cooker! I have the <a href="https://amzn.to/2U30I0m" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">6 Quart Hamilton Beach Set ‘n Forget Programmable Slow Cooker</a> (affil link). I love it because you can adjust the time you want it to cook, and it automatically turns to warm when it’s done. It also has a probe for meat that automatically shuts off when done. I hated my old crock pot, it burnt everything and my food had a weird taste. This slow cooker is so great, I actually own several!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>This was fantastic!!! I made a few changes bc I didn’t have everything I needed&#8230;.<br />
-I used one can of white beans and 2 cans of pork and beans in tomato sauce.<br />
-I drained the white beans before using them but I left the pork and beans in their sauces. <br />
-I omitted the chicken broth, as the sauces from the beans were enough. <br />
-instead of bay leaves, I used dried sage. <br />
This recipe is great and clearly dynamic! Loved it. </p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>With such a small ingredient list, I was skeptical of the potential flavor, but this soup ended up being a hit in the household (where my husband had very high doubts). I did not do the first step of pureeing the beans in water &#8211; simply added them in rinsed and drained with the appropriate step. Also left out rosemary sprig. Ended up using my immersion blender at the very end of the process and soup still had a thickness with whole vegetables still present. Recommend!!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Loooooove this soup! Make it Summer, Winter, Spring or Fall. I don&#8217;t care what season it is because this soup is just that Darn Delicious. I add a touch of Cayenne Pepper for a little heat with this recipe and it never disappoints!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Wow! I love this recipe. I tried it tonight, and it was some of the best soup I have ever had. Highly recommend it! I did like other reviewers said and left out the cup of water with the beans pureed. I also used about 1 cup less of broth and didn&#8217;t need to blend 2 cups of the soup as it was thick enough for me.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Delicious! Perfect for a cold New England day. Made in the instant pot with a couple of changes:  Used 8oz of smoked ham steak, diced, instead of bacon. Pan fried the ham in my cast iron skillet, set aside, then sautéed veggies in the skillet.  Used 3 Tbsp tomato paste. Didn’t purée the beans, added everything including ham, to the instant pot.  After cooking, scooped out about 1.5 cups of beans and veggies and a little both, puréed with my immersion blender and added back to the pot. Seasoned with salt and pepper to taste. Yum! Only change I would make  next time would be to use less rosemary, just personal taste preference. Used WW recipe builder to calculate points, to check ham vs bacon and they were the same as original (blue/1).  Again, delicious! And 1 point per serving leaves plenty of room to add a slice of crusty bread.  </p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>This soup is simple, satisfying and delicious! Perfect for a cold, raw New England winter day. I was a little worried about the tomato paste (I usually find it overpowering in recipes) but it added that touch of acidity the soup needed. This will definitely be part of my regular rotation.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>This is REALLY good! I don&#8217;t really like beans, but this soup is filling and easy to make (with loads of flavor)! I didn&#8217;t puree a can of beans with water, but threw everything in the pot to cook, then used an immersion blender lightly at the end. This really is even better the next day, I&#8217;ll be adding this to the rotation and making larger batches to freeze. Love all your recipes, Gina! 🙂</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>My family grew up eating Campbells Soup Bean with Bacon. Good winter comfort food. This recipe reminded me of it and it was by far so much better. I added egg noodles because that was how we always ate it. Making this was just as easy and healthier. Will definitely be eating this again. Thanks</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Being on WW, I was wondering how I was going to make my Kielbasa Bean soup lighter because it uses canned bean with bacon soup, but this recipe worked wonderfully as a substitute.  We cut up and cooked turkey kielbasa and added it, some Worcestershire sauce and salt to the recipe.  It reminded me so much of my soup recipe but I’m sure it was a lighter version.  Thank you Gina!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Greetings!  First I love the sight and everything you make and love that you do WW POINTS!</p>
<p>I have a difficult time finding canned navy beans, I can only seem to find dried ones.  Are there any recommendations for a different bean to replace or a way to use the dried ones?</p>
<p>I own three of your books and love those too!  </p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>This is pretty good except next time I will omit the spinach. I learned I do not like greens in soup. The wilted spinach tastes slimy and I can&#8217;t handle the texture. I will just eat it with a side of veggies instead.<br />
Only three starts because it could use more seasonings as it tasted bland. I will say I use skinnytaste for almost all my recipes that we cook at home and I do have a few of her cook books. I like the idea of this recipe it just needs something more. The bacon is a great addition though I don&#8217;t see how 4 slices can cut it for the amount of soup this recipe yields. I made an entire package of bacon to go with it and add a little fat for satiety.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I made this soup last night, followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of adding a chopped jalapeno, for spice. I used the instapot method, and my stick blender. Very easy, and so flavorful! I salivate thinking about it! lol! Creamy and rich tasting, and the crumbled bacon really takes it over the top. This will not be my only time making this soup! Thanks for a wonderful, guilt free recipe!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Love this! Made it in my pressure cooker, so easy and delicious, ST recipes never let me down.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t find navy beans so I used cannellini beans, didn&#8217;t have fresh rosemary so used 1tsp of dry, and I don&#8217;t like celery so I replaced it with a leek. Served it with some wholegrain bread and garlic roasted caulini, it was a hit!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>this was a great soup! I made it vegan, left out the bacon and used veggie broth. I used dried beans that I had soaked well. followed all directions as stated for the instant pot, and it was a quick, tasty dinner! My husband topped it w/ some fake bacon bits, and had two big bowls. My kids didn&#8217;t care for it, but they don&#8217;t care for beans or soup, so no surprise there. I will certainly make this one again!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Kellie and Bonnie,</p>
<p>I used a mixture of canned beans, had great results. You might just find that chick peas take a bit longer (maybe 35 &#8211; 40 minutes) instead of the 25 minutes for the softer beans.</p>
<p>Gina, this is a lovely recipe, thank you! Even my meat loving husband loves it, because of the bits of bacon on top.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>This recipe seemed a bit out of my comfort zone as far as my own food preferences go, but I decided to give it a go since I love all your recipes that I’ve made and sure enough, this was no exception! Ridiculously easy to make, and absolutely delicious. I froze the leftovers in individual servings for lunches this week and it still tasted great heated back up in the microwave from frozen. This is definitely going on my regular rotation for meal prep lunches. The only tweaks I made were adding probably triple the amount of carrot (I’m a huge fan of carrots in soup) and 2 cloves of minced garlic. Fantastic! </p>

<p>I used canned great northern beans and thick cut bacon. The bacon was a bit fatty so I drained the grease before proceeding. </p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>This is a great dish! I used dried navy beans that I soaked overnight and six cups of fat free chicken broth. I didn’t have spinach but used kale which I chopped and added at the beginning of cooking. My family loved it, especially good after a cold, windy day.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I don&#8217;t much care for spinach, so use Kale in place of it. We grow our own Kale, so have alot of it. Come fall i freeze the Kale. Just cut it off the stem and put in a bag and freeze. It gets hard and becomes really small, like parsley. So you don&#8217;t have cut it up. This way you don&#8217;t waste it. Plus it good for you.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>This is a great fall/winter recipe! I made a couple of small changes by using dried beans and pre-cooking. When the bacon was almost done, I added the onion, celery, and carrots, and left the bacon in the mix when I added the beans. Next time, I would not puree the beans in water, but would use some of the chicken broth. This was a little thin for me, so not adding the extra water would help. But, this reminds me of the Campbell&#8217;s bean with bacon soup my mom used to give me when I was young. It was always one of my favorites. The flavor in this recipe is the best!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I made this last night for my lunches this week. It didn’t say to drain the bacon grease so I didn’t. However now there’s congealed grease sitting on top of the soup. It doesn’t look very appetizing 🙁 should I have drained the grease before cooking the vegetables? </p>

Also, used diced tomatoes instead of paste, only because I had some open, as well as diced carrot.  Thanks for a good, low point soup!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Hey there- I see in the ingredients it called for 3 cans of navy beans- and then in the cooking instructions it says to purée one can of beans with water. But the recipe never says anything about adding the additional 2 cans of beans. When are those added?</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Seriously tastes like you&#8217;ve been cooking all day. I cant decide if it&#8217;s the veggies, the beans, or the bacon that makes it the best. Probably all of them! I often find that I make this recipe when I&#8217;m needing to clean out my veggie drawer&#8230; so I make sure I always keep great northern beans on hand in the pantry. I ALWAYS double or triple this recipe. Freezes beautifully.</p>
<p>My personal tweaks:<br />
-No salt added beans<br />
-No salt added beef broth, instead of reduced sodium chicken broth<br />
-reduced sodium turkey bacon<br />
-red pepper flakes (mama likes it hott!)</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Made this in my instant pot with a few changes and it turned out wonderful. My changes were to use dried beans (a small white heirloom) that I cooked ahead and reserved the cooking water which I used in the soup with some chicken soup base. I did not puree any beans in the beginning. Instead, I just buzzed the final soup with my immersion blender a few times to the consistency I wanted. Accidentally added an extra tablespoon tomato paste plus a bit of fresh thyme along with the rosemary. To give it a more traditional bean and bacon feel like the kind I remember from my childhood, I added about a tablespoon each of Dijon mustard, molasses, and cider vinegar. Loved it and will most certainly make again!! Thanks for jump starting my creation!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>First Recipe with the pressure cooker. I&#8217;m curious are were we supposed to do this manual with the pressure cooker or hit soup and then adjust the time and high-pressure? It might be obvious, but I&#8217;m missing it. Also are we supposed to let the pressure leave naturally? Or we supposed to use the venting?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Love your recipes and tell everyone I can about the site</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>This is the first recipe I have tried from Skinny Taste and it was delicious. Hearty and delicious. Even my picky boyfriend who normally gravitates towards fried food and fast food really enjoyed eating this. We are both trying to get healthier and he tends to sabotage us with his bad eating but with food like this I am hoping we will be able to stay more on target.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I love your recipes and thought I had everything in the cupboards but sadly did not. Typically I wouldn&#8217;t comment since technically it&#8217;s not your recipe, but I thought you would appreciate the changes and may want to test this for a future soup. So I made this with leftover Pernil from Christmas instead of bacon and Goya Sofrito (yes, I could have made from scratch but&#8230;lazy) instead of tomato paste. Because of the changes I did not use the rosemary or bay leaf either. Everything else the same and it was fantastic (and better as leftovers today). Thank you for the inspiration!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Ok, I am very new to the Instant Pot movement (I am anticipating one for Christmas), but wouldn&#8217;t you use dried navy beans for an pressure cooker recipe? Or is there a different benefit of making this recipe in an Instant Pt?</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I made this soup today in the Instant Pot&#8230;I used dry navy beans as I don&#8217;t keep canned beans in the pantry.  To decrease fat further, I substituted smoked back bacon for the regular bacon. This is a delicious soup which will really hit the spot today . Thanks so much for a terrific recipe 🙂</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Ok, y&#8217;all. If you haven&#8217;t tried this recipe, TRY IT NOW! I&#8217;ve made this twice; the first time as written (+ garlic and onion powder, thyme, and sage) and the second time I made vegetarian friendly (veggie broth, no bacon, plus the spices/herbs mentioned). Both flavors were excellent! Gina, you are amazing! I&#8217;m so grateful for you!!! Thanks for all your wonderful recipes and for your hard work and creativity.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Made this tonight. Delicious! Few additions. Made your chicken broth using 2 chicken breasts (Onion, Carrot, celery, parsley, bay leaves, and few cups of water). Simmered for about an hour. Removed the chicken breasts and shredded the meat. Made the soup per the instructions Though used, the broth from the Chicken breast I cooked along with a few cups of store bought. I didn&#8217;t see any mention of salt and pepper amounts, so just used what I thought was appropriate. Added the shredded chicken in when I added the Spinach. Let it go on low for roughly another half hour.  Topped with the bacon and some homemade croutons (cubed a nice Italian loaf, tossed with olive oil and salt and pepper and baked them 10 mins or so at 400 degrees) .Topped everything with a little grated parmesan It&#8217;s officially a meal!!! thank you Gina</p>

This is my 3rd time making it in just a few months!  If I add more carrot to the recipe does that change the points? Prob not cause veggies are zero but I know carrots have a lot of sugar. </p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I just made this soup today! It is delicious! I love the spinach too! The only variation I did was to add the bacon into the entire pot to give it a more smoky flavor. Will definitely make it again!!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Just made this soup. Took a spoonful just to check seasonings and it is superb. Now I did do a few tweaks. One by accident. I ended up with three different kinds of canned beans. I had Great Northern Beans on hand. When I went to pick up two more I bought one Garbanzo and one Navy bean. Those were organic (Eden Brand)with no sodium.  Great combo. </p>
<p>I sauté  2 smoked ham hocks in organic coconut oil(TJ&#8217;S). Removed them and then added the celery(3 small stalks with leaves) and three carrots, medium sized and 2 small to medium onions. Added salt, pepper and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Added all three cans rinsed and drained and rest of ingredients. </p>
<p>I microwaved the bacon and broke into pieces. Will add when I serve the soup to me and my husband a bit later. Took spinach out so I won&#8217;t forget to add. I have 5 oz. will eye it for amount.  <br />
Can&#8217;t wait for dinner. But first&#8230;.. Happy hour with my husband. Our ritual. <br />
Thanks so much. Will be my go to bean soup. </p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I plan on making this soup. My mom used to make a bean soup and it was my favorite.  I thought I may add a ham hoc. Sauté it first and take J Bear&#8217;s idea and sautée the veggies in it. I would microwave my bacon as a topping since I would be adding the ham hoc. <br />
Need to get the rest of the ingredients. </p>
<p>To the person who had problems getting the beans cooked. This sometimes happens if the beans are old. Sometimes we don&#8217;t know how long they have been on the grocery shelf. I know many good cooks who have had this problem. So I stick to the canned ones. <br />
Thanks for all your great recipes. Need to try your tomato as I love Panera&#8217;s too. </p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Everyone always comments about the recipe before making it, but I actually made this sh*t and it&#8217;s honestly flipping amazing. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never even commented on a recipe before, but I had to come back to talk about this effing soup. Now I&#8217;ll be fair-I tweaked it. That&#8217;s what cooking is, it&#8217;s an art, not a science. If anything I would recommend a bit more tomato paste and more seasoning/salt/herbs, as well as some garlic (which I of course added), but overall the base recipe is fantastic. I didn&#8217;t know I&#8217;d love bacon and bean soup this much, but I do. It&#8217;s my favorite soup ever now, blows Panera&#8217;s creamy tomato out of the water (iiiiiiif you make it right. results may vary)</p>
<p>Oh, I also sauteed my carrots, onions, garlic and celery in some of the reserved grease leftover from cooking the bacon. It infused everything with a meaty, delicious flavor. Would recommend. </p>
<p>Kudos on the great recipe, I&#8217;m excited to try more from this site!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I made this yesterday and wish I had read your comment first &#8211; while it&#8217;s a really great recipe I found it desperately in need of some salt. I presume the recipe omits salt because of the bacon (?), and maybe the bacon I purchased from my particular deli doesn&#8217;t have as much salt as mass market produced bacon. In any case I think it&#8217;s an excellent base recipe and look forward to tweaking it similarly. 🙂</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>This was absolutely delicious, my new favorite Skinnytaste soup! I made it on the stovetop and instead of using a blender, I used my immersion blender at the beginning to purée the beans and then used it again for a little bit at the end to thicken, leaving some of the veggies in tact . So good!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I made this recipe on Sunday in the crock pot. My 11 year old daughter and I LOVED IT! She has been taking it in her lunch this week and is thrilled with the change from a boring old sandwich. Here&#8217;s my question &#8211; the little green bits on the rosemary stem fell off in the soup and it took forever to pick them all off because I didn&#8217;t think it would be good to eat them. Any suggestions? Thank you!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>HELP! I just made this, using dried beans because i couldn&#8217;t find canned. I used the quick soak method on the stove top. After the recommended time in the instant pot, the bean were still not tender. So I turned the pot back on for another 15 minutes. STILL not done! I know you haven&#8217;t made this with dried beans, but I&#8217;m hoping you can help me salvage the recipe. Do I just keep resetting the time? Do I finish on the stovetop? The beans are starting to stick to the bottom of the pot after two cycles through.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I made this tonight, it&#8217;s currently simmering and smells wonderful!</p>
<p>For those wondering, 1 cup of dried beans soaked = just over 2 cups of beans. So, I used 3 cups of dried to equal 3 cans. Brought 3 cups of dried in 6 cups cold water to boil, let boil covered for 3 minutes. Took off the heat, left covered to sit for an hour and a half. Drained the water and was left with about 6 1/2 cups of beans. </p>
<p>Thanks, Gina!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>This was great! I added some pepper/garlic powder,  but otherwise followed this to a T! Super flavorful. I really commend you. I love heavily seasoned things, and you tend to go lighter on seasonings/ingredients. It&#8217;s made me try to step back from adding so many things to my food. You have a great knack for making very flavorful dishes with only a handful of ingredients. AND your recipes always yield themselves well if someone does want to add something extra. Not everyone can do that. I&#8217;m so glad I found your site! Been following and making your recipes for several years now and you never disappoint! Thank you so much!!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>This was delicious!  I used Pancetta vs bacon and used chicken broth vs water when blending the first can of beans.  I also used dried rosemary, which was good but I know the fresh would have been even tastier.  My husband picked out the spinach &#8211; LOL!

<div class="comment-content"><p>I made the slow cooker version of this and it was awesome! My husband and my very picky 2 year old loved as well! The only thing I may do different next time is add less water or use my immersion blender instead of a blender because it wasn&#8217;t as thick as I would have liked. Thank you Gina for another great recipe! I have yet to be disappointed!</p>

I&#8217;m trying to understand the differences between the two, and not sure which I will get the most use from. And do you have recommendations of brands for either one? Thanks in advance.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Campbell&#8217;s Bean w/bacon soup is one of my childhood faves! It screams Back to School. I&#8217;m making this right now in the slow cooker (happened to have all ingredients in hand) and it already smells great (cuz, bacon), and yes, I&#8217;m sitting in a cozy chair reading a book. Preordered Gina&#8217;s Fast &amp; Slow and can&#8217;t wait for that one!  Cannellini / northern beans / navy beans  are three kinds of &#8220;white beans&#8221;, different in size and shape, but could all be used for this soup. I used northern beans. Looking forward to a yummy dinner. Thanks Gina </p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>It turned out wonderful! Thick, hearty, smoky and filling. I put both Rosemary and Thyme in my bouquet Garni and I hate doing dishes so instead of puréeing the first can of beans I just used the immersion blender on about ⅓ of the soup, leaving the rest as whole beans. I&#8217;m sure Gina&#8217;s is smoother, but as it was, it was really delicious. Super inexpensive to make, too for 4-6 meals. I wilted the spinach called for in the recipe, then put another handful in the bottom of my soup bowl and ladled the soup over it to give me added veggie power. Might be an option for the lady whose husband picked his out. Thanks Gina for a perfect Fall Starter. </p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>This recipe sounds amazing and I can&#8217;t wait to try it. One question though; there are references to both navy beans and white beans. I often use Great Northern White Beans in soups, but wondered if it made any difference which beans to use in this recipe, and more specifically, if it would change the SmartPoint values. Thanks!</p>
