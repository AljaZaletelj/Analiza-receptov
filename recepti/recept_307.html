Stuffed Cabbage Casserole</h2>
<p>I grew up eating stuffed cabbage and always loved when my Mom made it for dinner. This casserole version of the classic is so darn delicious! You may also like this <a href="https://www.skinnytaste.com/un-stuffed-cabbage-bowls-instant-pot-or-stove-top/">lazy stuffed cabbage bowl</a>!</p>

<p>I first tried this back in 2011 browsing other blogs&#8217; Top Dishes for that year (I always love those posts). I came across this recipe on <a href="http://www.kalynskitchen.com/2011/12/recipe-for-deconstructed-stuffed.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kalyn&#8217;s Kitchen</a> and I knew I HAD to try it!</p>
<p>This turned out great, and easily serves 10 people. Although stuffed cabbage doesn&#8217;t usually have cheese, I loved the addition of it in this recipe. Of course you can make it without the cheese if you prefer to keep it dairy free.</p>
<h2>Stuffed Cabbage Casserole Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Leftover can be frozen and reheated for another day. Freeze up to 3 months. Refrigerate up to 3 to 4 days.</li>
<li>To make it dairy-free omit the cheese.</li>
<li>To make it keto or low-carb, swap the rice out and add more meat.</li>
<li>Freezer directions: Let the casserole cool then freeze in portions in freezer safe containers. To reheat, thaw overnight in the refrigerator and then either microwave until hot or heat in the oven in an oven-safe dish covered with foil.</li>
<li>Split it among 2 smaller casseroles and freeze one for later, this always comes out great.</li>
</ul>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Excellent recipe. I however used ingredients I had on hand to substitute some things <br />
Ground turkey instead of beef. <br />
I used 26 ounces of diced tomatoes and a small can of tomato paste and spiced with some Italian seasonings to make my own sauce. <br />
I also used vegetable broth instead of water. <br />
I will definitely make it again. <br />
Even the pickiest eater in my household liked it. </p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I love this recipe. But I think the proportions of cabbage v. Meat mixture needs to be 1.5 lbs or beef and just one head of cabbage. I always have leftover cabbage and feel like I’m stretching the meat mixture.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>If you are a fan of cabbage rolls, this is your dish. My kids had reservations about it but I was determined to try it. This was delicious, comforting, and very filling. My only hack was that I added 1 tablespoon of brown sugar to the meat mixture. My mom always made a slightly sweet sauce for her cabbage rolls, so I had to do it. So good!!!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Made this tonight for dinner it was excellent! Gina your recipes are delicious my daughter also is cooking your recipes now. My husband likes things spicy so used Rotel diced tomatoes and green chilies, ground turkey and Italian seasoning blend on mozzarella on top. I will definitely add to rotation and I will try ground beef but turkey is what I had in fridge. Thank you Gina! I do not even put your cookbooks away they are on my desktop.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I also grew up with my Mom making stuffed cabbage on a regular basis. This definitely filled my stuffed cabbage fix without all the labor intensive work! The only change I made was subbing quinoa for the rice because I had some leftover in the fridge. I will definitely make it again. Thanks Gina!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>EXCELLENT! We loved it. My husband said, &#8220;Be sure and tell Skinnytaste how awesome this is!&#8221; LOL. I&#8217;ve been cooking your recipes for years now. He loves your recipes the best. I am allergic to beef so I subbed ground chicken and it turned out perfect. I am excited about the leftovers. Thank you!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I made this today and it was just delicious! Of course I love traditional stuffed cabbage so I couldn&#8217;t pass up giving this a try. All I can say is yum-o! Next time I might try adding some red pepper flakes for alittle kick and I added more cheese than it needed. I will make this over and over again!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Delicious and much easier than stuffing individual cabbage leaves! I added crushed red pepper flakes, used 1 large head of cabbage (was plenty), and par-cooked the cabbage (in two batches) in the microwave &#8211; was easier than sauteing. Leftovers are perfect too.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I’m so glad I found this recipe because it is a keeper. Now I did make several changes, but only because I didn’t have some of the ingredients on hand.  I used Valdalia onion, can of Rotel Tomatoes (it added just the right amount of heat), uncle Ben’s wild rice, Italian seasoning and sage instead of thyme and white cheddar. It is so good!! Many recipes have to have a  very specific taste profile but this one seems you can make many variations and it still shines. </p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>sue, i didn&#8217;t see a reply but as an avid cook i wouldn&#8217;t cut back on the olive oil and garlic because you need both for sauteing and for the base of the flavor for the dish! however, if you are on ww, that can of tomato sauce might be a tad higher in points. i&#8217;m going to make this dish this week also, i make one super similar to this that is my own recipe and it is delish! enjoy 🙂</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>This was so seriously tasty &amp; comforting. My husband cooked it for me &amp; substituted a short pasta (spiralli) as no brown rice was at hand. Definitely a keeper (husband &amp; recipe!) &amp; will be on high rotation in our household as we approach the southern hemisphere&#8217;s winter. (Greetings from Melbourne, Australia). Thanks to Kalyn &amp; to you Gina for reposting this recipe.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>As always, Gina came up with a yummy family dinner. We&#8217;re vegetarians, so I followed another user advice and used riced cauliflower in place of ground beef. I also chopped up a pepper I needed to get rid of and it complemented the flavors nicely. I cooked my rice in the instant pot, then cooked everything else in one pan. Cooked cauliflower, reserved in bowl &#8211; cooked cabbage, reserved in bowl, then I made the sauce and it came out so yummy. Was filling without being bloated. Huge hit!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I made this for dinner tonight, with a few minor tweaks and a couple of comments directed to other reviewers. I grew up eating stuffed cabbage. In the northern New Jersey, southeastern Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania-Dutch) region we called them pigs-in-a-blanket.</p>
<p>To those who commented that the dish was under-seasoned, you need to taste, taste, taste your food as you&#8217;re cooking and adjust the seasoning to your taste. To those who commented that they cooked the beef/tomato mixture as instructed and it was too loose or too dry &#8211; you didn&#8217;t follow the instructions properly. The recipe says to &#8220;Simmer until it&#8217;s hot and slightly thickened, about 15-20 minutes&#8221;. If you cooked the sauce for 15-20 minutes and it was too tight or too loose, you overcooked it or undercooked it. Most likely the burner was too hot or too cold. </p>
<p>Oh yeah, there were some comments regarding the non-standard measurements &#8211; how much is a cabbage or an onion in cups? In my case, the cabbage filled a 10&#8243; skillet to a depth of about 2&#8243; when raw so about 10 cups of cabbage. I cooked it completely through on the stove-top, about 25 minutes on medium-low heat covered. I used a portion of a leftover onion that was in the fridge. I&#8217;d say about 3/4 cup.</p>
<p>I noticed a few people commented that they wish it had some chopped bell pepper or Italian seasoning; you should always (except when baking pastries and such) feel free to doctor the ingredients to what you prefer. I make an awesome mustard dill potato salad. My sister doesn&#8217;t like dill so when she makes potato salad she leaves out the dill.</p>
<p>That said, this recipe is an excellent starting place. I made 1/2 the recipe as I live alone and didn&#8217;t want 8 or 9 portions leftover (my freezer&#8217;s pretty well stocked). I swapped out the brown rice for hulled barley &#8211; more protein, more fiber, and fewer carbs. My grandmothers always took their stuffed cabbage in that slightly sweet and sour direction so I added a heavy pinch of sucralose and a couple of tsp of white vinegar.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I honestly thought this recipe looked like a bit of a hassle and I almost went ahead and made a one pan version of this I’ve had before but I am so glad I put the work into this meal. It was delicious!! My 6 year old ate a full portion without stopping. Every single bite. I had seconds and my husband loved it too. We have plenty leftover for another meal. Can’t wait to make this again. Also I subbed cheddar cheese and I’m glad I did- I think it brings more flavor than mozzarella would, though I may try it that way next time to compare. </p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Your comments are spot on Jim. But I find a lot of people need baby steps &amp; hand holding in the kitchen, &amp; I supposed I did too until I became bolder &amp; not afraid to fail. As I said in my comment we substituted short pasta for brown rice as we didn&#8217;t have any. People shouldn&#8217;t be afraid to substitute ingredients to their liking. And yes, taste, taste, taste!!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>This was really yummy! It took a bit longer than I expected to put together, but there is enough to last a few nights now so the effort was worth it. I used one big head of green cabbage and it was plenty. I also used ground turkey because that&#8217;s what I had on hand. I read some of the comments and decided to serve it with sour cream&#8230; SO good! Really elevates the flavor.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>This is an excellent casserole and ai have made it several times. I used cauliflower crumble instead of ground beef as I am a vegetarian and several members of my family are too. It was delicious, full of flavour and It made 10 generous portions. Love your recipes and have tried several of them. Keep up the good work. Many thanks.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I made this recipe hoping that it would mirror something my mom made growing up and my brother and I called Lazy Cabbage Rolls. After originally looking at the recipe, I didn&#8217;t feel there was enough meat (I used ground turkey as opposed to ground beef) but I made it as written except I had 1 head of cabbage. As I expected there was not enough meat or sauce to effectively coat the cabbage. Next time I would change to 2 lbs of ground turkey and add extra diced tomatoes and tomato sauce. It tasted OK but the overall opinion in our family was it needed more meat.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>My husband and I both loved this casserole! I improvised and only cut up one head of cabbage, added a diced green pepper, used chili powder since I didn&#8217;t have paprika, and substituted Beyond Burger for the ground beef. De-lish. There was lots left over so I will be freezing it and enjoying it again. This one is a keeper!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Okay. So. This took a lot of time for me. I’m slow to chop lol but it wasn’t that bad as prep goes. Just pay attention to the bake times. I had one head of cabbage but two medium onions. So that is what I used and it was still almost too much for my 11 x 9 dish. Otherwise everything the exact same. My hubby and I really enjoyed it!! So freaking tasty, just loved it!! We also used a small dollop of sour cream with it cause we are weird lol. Have lunch for us tomorrow and we are having leftovers for dinner tomorrow with lunch again for two the next day. Now you can’t beat that for such an expensive dish. So economical and tasty!! Like I said, just be aware of time and you will be good!  I might add mushrooms next time 🙂 oh oh and I might try it with ground turkey or chicken yay! Thanks, Gina!!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I made this 2 months ago and it was waiting for me in the freezer. Took it out Christmas Day to thaw knowing I would want an easy meal after the hectic holidays. It cooked up perfectly and I served it with a salad. I was crossing my fingers on this one since 2 people don’t like cabbage in the family. My son is one of them and he mentioned the cabbage reminded him of macaroni. The only negative thing he said was that it could use a little less cabbage next time but he said it as he was getting seconds. Both cabbage haters got seconds. It is hard to find a meal like by 100% of the family so this is a keeper. Big enough for two meals so I froze the leftovers for later.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I must admit I have never had stuffed cabbage before but I kept wishing this had a different flavor profile.  Once I added grated Romano cheese it tasted much better but I just felt it was missing something.  I wish there was a version of this that had Italian spices like oregano or the addition green pepper, like a stuffed pepper casserole.  I’m glad I tried this but I doubt I’ll make it again.  I wish I was an accomplished enough cook to figure out how to revise it into something I would love.  </p>

I think peppers are a great idea &#8211; I&#8217;d just dice them up and if you want to add oregano maybe start with a tsp and see how you like it. This is one of my fav recipes but I do tend to mix it up with different sauces and cheese sometimes.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I made this for dinner one night and pre-portioned and freezed most of the rest for easy lunch time meals. My dad, who is pretty picky with food, raided our fridge one day and proclaimed &#8220;this some sort of cabbage lasagna&#8221; &#8220;pretty good!&#8221; I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s complimented anything cabbage related in his life, so this is a total win!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Very good! Bought shredded cabbage at Trader Joe’s and as someone else mentioned I probably needed more but still delicious none the less. I’ve read great things about it leftover and can’t wait for lunch tomorrow! Thanks for another great recipe, Gina!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>This recipe was a little time consuming for a meal on s weeknight but my Grandpa loved it and that&#8217;s what counts! I made a mistake using Trader Joe&#8217;s shredded cabbage as they don&#8217;t carry heads of cabbage right now. I used 2 bags but I think I should have used 3. I&#8217;d like to know how much cabbage to use in another measurement. Also the shredded cabbage is pretty fine and I think if I had used heads and chopped it, I would have gotten the consistency better. My mistake, not Gina&#8217;s. Thanks for another great recipe!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Used ground turkey instead also sprinkled a little cayenne pepper in with the sauce as we like things a little spicy. Won&#8217;t lie&#8230; glad I waited to make this on a Friday because once you get everything in the dish it has to bake for an hour but Man O Man was it worth it! Hubby and I really enjoyed this. I cant wait to have the leftovers for dinner to tonight. Wonderful recipe!!!!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Just made this the other night and when I saw it pop up again on your weekly menu I had to follow up and with a positive comment. It was incredible! Warm and comforting. Not being a beef-eater, I swapped it for ground turkey and could not have been more pleased with the results. thanks!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>This recipe was absolutely delicious! I used ground turkey in place of the beef and fat free mozzarella. I did miss the step making where the cabbage is cooked separately and then layered as I combined all when pre-cooking before but it was a hit with the family so I don&#8217;t think anyone noticed!  Thank you!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I saw in the comments was 12 packed cups of raw cabbage. I&#8217;m about to make it for our dinner tonight. I like to take a dish like this and make it my own. Will use a chopped jalapeno, half a chopped red bell pepper, 2 cups brown cooked rice, can rotel tomatoes, can diced tomatoes, a cup of frozen sweet green peas, or english peas, my favorite spices and 2 different kinds of cheese, layered with the other ingredients. Will need a bigger pan, disposable foil one. You could make this casserole different each time.

<div class="comment-content"><p>Years ago I stopped boiling noodles before layering them in my lasagna dish because it was an unnecessary step.  The sauce does the job while the dish cooks in the oven.  Perfectly cooked noodles every time.  I’m betting the same thing happens with the cabbage leaves in this recipe, layered under the meat sauce.  When I make this dish I plan to eliminate Step 7 (except for seasoning) because the cabbage will cook with the rest of the dish while in the oven. </p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I&#8217;ve made this using exact ingredients minus the cheese, but in a slow cooker. Nowadays I add the chopped onions plus a chopped green pepper directly with the ground beef to sauté, saving having to use olive oil. We love it. We&#8217;ve found it is much better the next day, so now I make it a day ahead.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Has anyone figured out the measurements for the cabbage? I feel it should be in the instructions. The head I bought today is HUGE!! I don&#8217;t want to overwhelm the dish with too much cabbage. Also has anyone made this in a slow cooker or maybe in a Dutch oven instead of a large casserole dish? (Still rebuilding my kitchen supplies thanks to my ex😜) And if so did you omit sauntering the cabbage?</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I love this recipe&#8211;I split it among 2 smaller casseroles an freeze one for later&#8211;always comes out great. Also, I cook the cabbage in the pan first, then wipe it out and reuse the same pan to make the sauce. I saute the beef along with the onion and then add in all the rest of the ingredients. This way, if your rice is already made it&#8217;s only 1 pot to clean up at the end.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>We love this in my house, but I don&#8217;t make it very often because it does take some work &amp; time. My husband (who is a meat &amp; potatoes type guy) just actually asked me why we haven&#8217;t had it in a while and requested I make it. That says a LOT about how good this is so its on the menu for the weekend. We only eat about half and the leftovers freeze just as well as stated. I did cook my cabbage a little too well one time so it was a little too mushy after freezing a reheating so beware of that, but that was my fault. Just keep the cabbage a good al dente and you&#8217;ll be fine.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I used to make this with the leanest ground beef I could find. Now I make it but instead of ground beef I use that vegetarian &#8220;beef&#8221; substitute and it tastes just as amazing as the first day I made this receipe and I just love it. One of my favorite recipes from this whole site! Thanks for sharing it 🙂</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I have made this recipe many times and it is delicious!!! I was wondering if you would be able to revise this recipe for the Instant Pot? I bet it would cut down on a lot of the preparation time.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the great recipes Gina!!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I&#8217;d like to suggest a hack. I made this once and it was super delicious but a lot of work and not a good weeknight meal because of the time involved. I also love the unstuffed cabbage rolls recipe https://www.skinnytaste.com/un-stuffed-cabbage-bowls-instant-pot-or-stove-top/. So this time around I made that in my instant pot and we will have it for dinner tonight, then tomorrow will take the leftovers, throw them in a casserole and dump the cheese on top and bake for 20 to get the yummy casserole.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>This was a lot of work so while making it I thought I may never make this again&#8230; until I tasted it! This was amazing and worth the work. My husband isn&#8217;t the biggest cheese fan, so I left that off and used cauliflower rice instead of brown. I think next time I will just mix it together and then bake, no need for me to layer.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>It is definitely still cauliflower but the texture is spot on. In a dish like this with so many strong flavors I think cauliflower rice would be an excellent choice. Or perhaps a blend. I blend regular rice with cauliflower rice when I make fried rice and the become indistinguishable from each other.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>This recipe is fabulous. I used diced fire-roasted diced tomatoes with green chilies (Rotel brand) because that&#8217;s what I had on hand. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as directed. I found that an approximately 2-1/2 lb. cabbage was enough.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I remember having the old school version of this when I was younger and HATING it. Isn&#8217;t it funny to think about what we used to not like as kids? This recipe was fabulous! I only added about 1/4 cup of freshly grated rosemary asiago cheese from Trader Joes. I also subbed sage for thyme because I was out. I ended up only cooking it for about 40 minutes total and it was PERFECT! My husband and I gobbled half of the huge pan up right away.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I almost made it without rice last night but then I cauliflower rice instead. Since the cauliflower didn&#8217;t absorb any of the liquid like the brown rice would it was just a little bit more like a soup/stew when served which we didn&#8217;t mind. I also made it without the cheese. When I put in the recipe I ended up making the dish for 2 points a serving 🙂</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Now that ground turkey breast is 0 points on Weight Watchers Freestyle program, it would lower the overall point value. Sometimes switching beef out with turkey works but sometimes it doesn’t.  I wonder how would it taste.  Have you tried it with ground turkey breast? </p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Love this recipe! It’s a little “steppy”, but if you use the frozen steamable rice it cuts down a little work. I like adding a little red pepper for a kick. THis taste very similar to my mother in laws cabbage rolls that I love so much. My favorite way to serve this is with black eyed peas and cornbread topped with hot sauce.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I made this last night and it was wonderful.  Due to what I had on hand I swapped out farro for the rice.  My husband loved it!!!  And he is always resisting the whole grains.  I didn&#8217;t cook the farro separately, as I was averse to dirtying another pan, so I added two cups of beef broth to the sauce and added the farro at that point.  I simmered the sauce for as long as it took to soften the cabbage and the farro finished cooking in the oven.  It turned out wonderful.  My husband is a hunter so I used ground moose meat instead of ground beef and it was delicious.  Also sprinkled it with parmesan and a light sprinkle of Mexican blend cheese, as I was out of mozzarella.   Much easier than cabbage rolls and all the flavor.  Loved it!  Great recipe! </p>

He loves stuffed cabbage rolls, but the flavors here were just a little bland and not much depth. For that reason though, I can actually see why this might be a hit with kids, but for us it just tasted like canned tomatoes 🙁</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Love this recipe! It was very easy to make and was very yummy! I make this for my dad&#8217;s birthday and he went back for more. It makes a lot and we have enough for another meal. I am going to freeze it tonight. The only thing I changed I added tomato soup I place of the tomato sauce. I only had to put the casserole in for about 20 min to melt the cheese. Will make this recipe again for sure. </p>

Without the rice there is hardly any carbs in it. Piled on the cheese. Oh, my it was delicious. I will have to make sure I use leftovers the next time too.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I may be late to the game, but I just tried this recipe. It takes awhile to prep, but it is DELICIOUS!! Since it is a lot for 2 people, I&#39;m happy to freeze for later. My heads of cabbage were small, so I should have used more (might be good to put an apprx # of cups). I made too much brown rice, but was happy to learn that I can actually freeze brown rice for other SkinnyTaste recipes! Thank you SO much for adding SmartPoints to your recipes. You&#39;ve saved my WW life!! </p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>My simplification of this recipe was to start cooking the rice in the microwave while chopping the onions and garlic. Then I put the rice and water in the bottom of a 9X13 pan, layered raw ground turkey, cabbage, tomatoes and seasonings, and then baked it until the rice was done. (I actually used bagged shredded cabbage, because that&#39;s what I had on hand.) Fast and easy, and very little clean up.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>followed the recipe as instructed but the casserole came out dry and the cabbage undercooked. IMO needs less cabbage and more tomato sauce. Also needs to be cooked longer. I added 20 minutes on to the cooking time to have soft cabbage and added another can of tomato sauce. Otherwise great recipe, will be making again.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I made it today with meatless crumbles instead of ground beef. 2 cups of cheese is very excessive in my book! I used 3 oz. Kraft fat free mozzarella and sprinkled it across the top for a little flavor. I also used fresh thyme. Outcome: a lot of work but well worth it. I didn&#39;t buy shredded cabbage, so shredding added to the prep work. A great dish to add to my growing repertoire. Thanks for this wonderful site. </p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>This dish was heaven. Although it took me a long while to make it the prep time was well worth it once I tried this. Not sure if it makes much of a difference but I couldn&#39;t find low fat cheese from Sargento so I got one that said reduced fat instead. I also could not find 95% lean beef the closest they had at the grocery store I go to was 93% so I had to use that. But other than that the dish was amazing I highly recommend this to anyone who is thinking about making it.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>This was good. I was surprised that a recipe to rework stuffed cabbage to a healthier version is actually less healthy with the addition of cheese. I made it with ground turkey and left out the cheese. You can sprinkle some on the individual servings as desired when serving. It&#39;s also more work than regular stuffed cabbage. </p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I loved it. I subbed ground turkey for the beef &#8211; cooked it in bacon grease, then drained. I needed more oil for the cabbage than the recipe called for and I ended up added 3x the amount of thyme and paprika, and 2x the garlic. I will probably use even more seasoning overall, seasoned tomatoes and cut the amount of the tomato sauce. But it was delicious and way less time consuming than making cabbage rolls.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>This looks wonderful! I&#39;ve actually never tried stuffed cabbage with tomatoes &#8211; we usually use Cream of Mushroom (which is delicious-BTW). This definitely looks like a more practical approach than the usual stand &amp; stuff &#39;em &#8230; Thanks for sharing this. I have a feeling I&#39;ll be eating your (almost) Stuffed Cabbage recipe with considerable frequency. </p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Made this last night &#8211; it was a hit!!! Here are my modifications&#8230; to the cabbage mixture, I added browned bacon pieces (probably not as low fat&#8230;.) and sauerkraut (I know it sounds weird, but that&#39;s what my Hungarian mother-in-law puts in her cabbage rolls and they&#39;re awesome!!) This dish tasted like cabbage-rolls: with much less work!!! Thanks 🙂</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I tried this recipie last night and funny story&#8230;..I missed the &#39;cooked&#39; rice part so stirred in raw rice (like jambalaya recipes) so from start to finish took me about 3 hours to cook the rice in the meat sauce. A few times I was starting to lose hope that it would cook but I wasn&#39;t giving up and it was worth the wait! My fiance told me that he wasn&#39;t sure he liked cabbage before I made it and after he ate it asked me if he could take it for lunch the next day and helped me package it up for future freezer meals. Very easy to make (if you use cooked rice as the recipie states!) and a really nice change! Thanks Gina! </p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I made this about a week ago. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef, as I like the taste of turkey better. I accidentally used 2 whole heads of cabbage, and I didn&#39;t have any brown rice so I used white. It was DEEEELICIOUS, surprisingly low calorie, and made several meals for my boyfriend and I. It took me about an hour and a half to make, as I&#39;m not very fast in the kitchen, but it was so worth it.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>This was great! I used sweet Italian sausage instead of the ground beef, only one head of cabbage as it would have overflowed out of my dish, and I also mixed everything together instead of layering it. Much easier than stuffing cabbage rolls, and you get more cabbage per serving! Yummy!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I made this last weekend for Sunday lunch&#8211;it was delicious.<br />Changes:<br />used full-fat riccota mixed with one egg and 6 cheese Italian blend<br />used 1 small can of tomato paste instead of tomato sauce, added water and simmered for two hours<br />used meatloaf mixture (ground beef, veal and pork) in place of just ground beef<br />added diced celery and chopped green pepper to the meat/tomato/onion mixture.<br />cooked the cabbage and onions with two slices of bacon for flavouring.</p>
<p>This is a recipe that will become part of my standards.<br />Thanks!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I adapted this wonderful recipe this past weekend for Sunday lunch. It was delicious and will be a recipe I go to regularly. Changes: used meatloaf blend (beef, veal, pork)instead of plain beef.<br />used one can of tomato paste instead of tomato sauce<br />added chopped celery and chopped green pepper to the meat/tomato/onion mixture<br />boiled the cabbage with two slices of smoked bacon<br />used full fat riccota with an egg mixed in<br />used full fat Italian six-cheese blend.<br />It was truly delicious, better than with traditional pasta, I think.<br />Even better reheated for lunch today!<br />Thanks!</p>

Most people who like the idea of a Stuffed Cabbage casserole grew up in that area with older women relatives who made the real deal Stuffed Cabbage Rolls. I even had them at my wedding in Washington, PA, 31 years ago!!!!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>A really wonderful dish (I never comment until I&#39;ve actually MADE something!) Despite an &quot;oops&quot; in assembly &#8211; I originally forgot to add the rice, had it already in the pan when I remembered, so it was not neat layers but full on mixed casserole &#8211; it was great. Leftovers the next day even better. I made half the dish w/ one cup of shredded cheese, one half with not, for days I have more flexibility in points and those days I don&#39;t 🙂 Freezes well. Big hit here &#8211; and I would say for those who don&#39;t like the smell of cooked cabbage that it didn&#39;t smell &quot;cabbage-y&quot; and tasted mild (but tasty!) </p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>This was delicious! I used 1.5 cups rice instead of 2 and added 2 tbsp brown sugar to the meat/onion/tomato mixture which gave it a little bit of sweetness. I cut it into 8 servings instead of 10 which so it was 6 points without cheese or 8 with. Very filling and so yummy!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I decided to try this recipe on Sunday. So Yummy!! Great with garlic bread too..<br />I left out the rice, used ground turkey, added couple of sliced black olives &amp; a little more cheese. We have 2 picky eaters in the family, a 7 &amp; 4 year old, they cleaned their plates! Yay!!<br />Amazing! Delicious leftovers too!! I actually thought I would have a lot more leftovers but it&#39;s all gone :(. I guess that means it will be a definite go to recipe in this house!! Thank you, thank you!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I&#39;ve made this a couple times now and have had people ask for the recipe. (I always give credit where credit is due!) </p>
<p>This week, I made it more like the stuffed cabbage my mom made while I was growing up, which is my favorite meal ever. I substituted a can of whole cranberry sauce for the petite diced tomatoes. AMAZING! Sounds weird, I know, but try it for something different.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Let me first start by saying that I LOVE Skinnytaste. I make something from this site at least 4 times a week and have never been disappointed. Based on all of the great reviews for this recipe, I had really high hopes for this. I also love cabbage and have made cabbage rolls many times in the past.<br />Unfortunately, both myself and my husband thought this was, well, awful. 🙁 He actually said &quot;please don&#39;t ever make this again&quot;. <br />Here are the issues I found with it:<br />1 1/2 heads of cabbage is way too much for this casserole. I ended up picking a ton out while eating it, and was left with a HUGE mound on my plate of extra cabbage.<br />The cabbage was also pretty hard and undercooked. I had cooked it on the stove until it was wilted and almost done and then it cooked in the oven for an hour. I would suggest cooking it completely on the stove first.<br />The cabbage requires A LOT of salt in order to taste ok. I had salted it while cooking and actually thought it might be too much, but it needed a TON more while eating it. I would also suggest seasoning the beef when you cook it so it doesn&#39;t just taste like hamburger meat.<br />There wasn&#39;t enough sauce in this recipe. The rice soaked up all of it (and I used less rice than called for). I would suggest putting extra sauce into the layers when assembling this. <br />Finally, we did not care for the combination of the mozzarella cheese and cabbage. While it looked delicious, it didn&#39;t taste that way.<br />Unfortunately, I actually dumped the remaining casserole directly into the garbage and won&#39;t be making this again. This is quite disappointing because, as I said, I&#39;ve never tried a Skinnytaste recipe I didn&#39;t like (and I&#39;m a huge supporter!!).<br />If you plan to make this, I would highly suggest following my tips for a better result. In the future, I will stick with the traditional cabbage rolls I&#39;ve made in the past.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Let me start by saying, that I love Skinnytaste &#8211; I make something from here almost every single night. I also really like cabbage and have made cabbage rolls many times in the past. Based on all of the amazing reviews here, I had really high hopes for this one.<br />Unfortunately, this was the first thing I&#39;ve ever made that my husband literally said &quot;please do not make this ever again&quot;.<br />Here&#39;s why:<br />It was EXTREMELY bland. Even after I salted the meat while cooking (which the recipe doesn&#39;t say to do), salted the sauce, and salted the cabbage (to the point I thought it might be too salty), It needed A LOT more salt. <br />1 1/2 heads of cabbage is WAY too much. It probably would&#39;ve been good with NO MORE than 1 head maybe even less than that.<br />The cabbage was hard and undercooked. I cooked it almost all the way on the stove, and then an hour in the oven, but it was still hard. I would suggest cooking it completely on the stove first.<br />It was VERY dry. The rice soaks up all of the tomato sauce. If you are used to saucy cabbage rolls as I am, I highly suggest adding extra sauce when you are assembling the casserole.<br />We also did not like the flavor combination of the mozarella cheese and cabbage &#8211; I would never combine those two every again. Yuck. <br />While it looked really appetizing, it unfortunately didn&#39;t taste that way.<br />I&#39;m usually a big advocate of &quot;left over night&quot;, but immediately after dinner, I threw the remaining one half of the casserole directly into the garbage can 🙁 <br />To address a comment above, this is NOT a quick and easy recipe. It took me nearly an hour to put it all together, and then it has to bake for an hour. In the future, I think I will stick to traditional cabbage rolls, but to those thinking about making this, please follow my tips above and possibly yours will turn out much better.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Let me first start off by saying that I love Skinnytaste. I have never made something from here that we haven&#39;t LOVED. Unfortunately, this is the first recipe that my husband literally said &quot;please don&#39;t ever make this again&quot;. I was really expecting it to be great, based on all of the reviews above, and past experience with Skinnytaste. I also really love cabbage and have made the traditional cabbage rolls many times in the past.</p>
<p>As Becky said above, one of the main issues, was that it was dry.<br />Here are some tips if you are going to make this:<br />1) Add extra tomato sauce to it. After mixing the rice with the beef, it soaked up all of the tomato sauce, and was VERY dry. </p>
<p>2) Season the meat, sauce and cabbage with SALT. The meat should be seasoned while cooking, so it doesn&#39;t just taste like bland hamburger meat with tomatoes. The cabbage needs A LOT of salt in order to taste good, otherwise it will be extremely bland.</p>
<p>3) This is WAY too much cabbage for this recipe. I had to take a bunch out while I was eating it, and was left with a huge pile of cabbage in my plate.</p>
<p>4) Cook the cabbage completely before putting into the casserole. I cooked it almost all the way as the recipe says, but it was still very hard after baking in the oven.</p>
<p>We also did not care for the combination of mozzarella cheese and cabbage. While it looked really appetizing, it didn&#39;t taste that way.<br />So to sum up, extra sauce, lots of salt, use less cabbage and cook it completely before baking. (Oh, and it is NOT fast and easy). It took me nearly an hour to put it all together and then it needs to bake another hour. Needless to say, we ate a very late dinner).<br />In the future, I will just stick with cabbage rolls.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I just made this and I would change one thing. I cooked the meat, sauce, onion mixture for the time instructed and then added the rice. The mixture was rather dry so when I baked the casserole it was like meat and rice on top of cabbage, not really the moist casserole that is shown in the picture. I poured tomato juice on top when i added my cheese. This helped marry the two layers better but I was left with a runny tomato like juice in the bottom of the pan. I&#39;m hoping next time that if I don&#39;t cook the tomato sauce down as much as directed, the problem will be solved without having to add juice.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I made this last night and it was awesome! Thank you so much. I was looking for something to get me out of the grilled chicken and tilapia stump. I used half of the thyme (as I don&#39;t care for it too much) and added a little crushed red pepper flakes to the meat mixture while it was simmering. Gave it a little kick. Again, this was a great recipe and I will definitely recommend it to people.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I just made this and love it. Although time consuming, I&#39;ll definitely make it again. I did not have paprika and only used one head of cabbage. I think the next time I&#39;d use the suggested amount of 1-1/2 heads of cabbage. Mine sorta dried out while baking but think it was because I had no foil to cover it. I may try another can of tomato sauce and/or diced tomatoes next time. Regardless, it&#39;s one of those dishes you can tweak and make your own or follow recipe to the letter, and you will not be disappointed!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Mine is currently in the oven, cannot wait to try it &#8211; just one thing I realised half way through &#8211; maybe my cabbages were way too big? After cutting one half and getting part way through cutting another half, I already had more than sufficient cabbage. I kind of had a cabbage freak out!<br />I also think for the amount of cabbage I had I would use more meat/tomato next time as the layers barely covered the cabbage. Not sure if that&#39;s the idea or not&#8230;<br />Loved the reader above who made it more Lebanese style &#8211; I was thinking of adding a bit of cinnamon and all spice as well as I&#39;m used to my grandma&#39;s boiled cabbage rolls &#8211; maybe try next time!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Just found your website a week ago, and this is already the second recipe I&#39;ve tried. This blog is so inspiring, I already have a fridge full of fresh ingredients, and a freezer full of ready to eat, portioned meals. I love cabbage rolls, so this casserole is perfect. Personally, I found one large head of cabbage to be enough, but if you like the flavor &#8211; the more the merrier. I also realized too late I was out of dried thyme, but substituted some fresh rosemary I had on hand. Next time, I would add more sauce for my own taste, but overall this recipe and idea were totally killer. thank you so much!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I was planning on making cabbage rolls for dinner last night since I had a large cabbage to use, when I decided to check your recipes and I found this. It sounded good and easier, well it was a winner! I also used ground turkey and I had leftover white rice I used. Thanks for all the great recipes plus the point values for this lifetime WW!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Gina, my grandmother was of Czech descent so I adore stuffed cabbage but can&#39;t be bothered to take the time to make it, so this recipe has become our new family favorite! I tweaked it a bit with red pepper flakes the second time I made it because it didn&#39;t have enough spice for us. I wanted to make it (and 4 other meals) on my day off yesterday, so I used the bagged coleslaw mix to save some chopping time and it came out great! I also used diced tomatoes with chile peppers and an Italian blend cheese. We love, love, love this dish!!! Thanks so much!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I live in Alaska.. I check skinnytaste every other friday for all of my recipes for the following 2 weeks dinner menu.. That way I can have all of my ingredients at home and not have to travel to town for one thing or another. My recipe box is filling up! Used to be that I had to think and think to plan a menu and could never get enough days filled.. Now I have so many delicious recipes that I have more recipes than days to fill 🙂 I substitute moose for beef and sometimes turkey and you cannot tell the difference! I LOVE how easy your site is and how much easier my life it with it! Thank you!!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Oh wow, I would be interested in the above poster&#39;s version with venison. I am using turkey. I seasoned the meat while browning as I have found this helps add flavor when using turkey (which can be a little bland). I also steamed and blended carrots (about 1 cup) into the tomato sauce before adding it to the pan. I have always done this with my tomato sauces when my son was young. It adds a vibrant color and nice subtle taste. I will skip the cheese, as I have never eaten stuffed cabbages in this manner. The other addition to the sauce is a little sauerkraut. Odd, I know, but this is how a lot of locals make their stuffed cabbage. My kitchen smaells so yummy right now&#8230;&#8230;onto making the cauliflower soup 🙂</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>OMG!! I made this tonight in anticipation of it being tomorrow nights dinner. I took it out of the over and had to have a few sample bites to see how it tasted. Well needless to say it was AWESOME and I ended up have a small plate of it and started to go back for more and had to refrain myself. I will be making this again and again! </p>
<p>Gina, would this be easy enough to do in a crock pot and would any changes need to be made to the recipe in order to cook it in a crock pot? Thanks for such a terrific recipe Gina!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Gina &#8211; love your site. Two notes:</p>
<p>Were we supposed to drain the meat? I did.</p>
<p>and Even though I did drain the meat, I had alot of liquid pooled in the bottom of the pan so after I got the first row of servings out, I propped one of the short ends of the dish with a cookie sheet and let the juice drain from the other end that still was in tact and then soaked up the juice with paper towels. I repeated that two more times. Today it was very uniform and in tact and easy to cut leftovers from.</p>
<p>Loved the recipe &#8211; very filling.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I made this for dinner tonight, and it was so good! I used more than a pound of meat so I added a second can of tomato sauce, and to save calories, I didn&#39;t use the cheese. I also used a blend of brown, red, and black rice. SO good. My grandmother, Honey, used to make cabbage rolls. This recipe was as good as hers and easier! Thanks!!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>So warm and yummy on a cold night. Made it with a 16 oz bag of tri color cole slaw instead of dealing with the cabbage head&#8230;because I&#39;m lazy like that.

<div class="comment-content"><p>Gina, I &lt;3 you! My 1 year WW anniversary was this week and I&#39;ve lost 50 pounds since I started. I certainly couldn&#39;t have done it without your awesome recipes.</p>
<p>This casserole was absolutely awesome. I&#39;m not a huge cabbage fan but my bf grew up on cabbage rolls so I figured we&#39;d give it a whirl. I added saffron (since that&#39;s in his family recipe) and left off the cheese. We both loved it! This is totally a keeper in my book.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>To Anonymous. If a recipe says 2 Cups of cooked rice &#8211; it means cook the rice &amp; then measure out 2 cups. If it says 2 cups of rice, cooked. Then it means to measure out 2 cups of rice &amp; cook it. Actually I think Gina typically would say 2 cups of uncooked rice &amp; then talk about cooking it in her recipe if she measured the uncooked rice in her ingredients list &#8211; at least that&#39;s what I&#39;ve found. Hope that helps! (so in this recipe you&#39;d need to measure your rice after you cook it).</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I asked you last week, but you didnt understand my question. The recipe calls for 2 cups of cooked rice. Did you measure 2 cups of dried rice first, and than cooked it &amp; put it into the recipe? Or did you cook a pot of rice, than went and measured out 2 cups of already cooked rice. I am asking, because as you know, there is a big difference in 2 cups of dried rice and 2 cups of already cooked rice. I do understand that the rice needs to be cooked before putting it into the recipe. Thanks, Holly</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I made this last night also. It was delish! I did add half of a sauteed green pepper chopped fine to the sauce and 1 pack of splenda. I only used 1 cup of cheese, so it felt less sinful..LOL I also cut it in 8 pieces, which doing the math was almost 9 points. My husband loved it. I divided the 6 portions in half this morning (4.5 pts) and had one for lunch. It is even better reheated! This will be a staple on my WW from now on!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I&#39;ve made a version of this recipe but found a GREAT shortcut! I use one bag of &quot;pre-bagged coleslaw mix&quot; from the produce section. Then, there&#39;s no need to chop the cabbage. Worked out great! Just thought I&#39;d share this time-saving tip. : )</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I made this on the weekend and my fiancé was RAVING about it. I tweaked it a bit with my favorite cabbage roll spices (cinnamon, allspice) and didn&#39;t use quite the same amount of cabbage because I only had one head but it was still great. Lots of leftovers to stick in the freezer for his lunch! I made it without the cheese as he is lactose intolerant, but I am guessing that would have made it even better!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Thanks for inspiring me to finally try a deconstructed version of stuffed cabbage in my crock&#8230;it worked AWESOME!&#8230;I only used one head of cabbage though cooked it on high for 1 hr and 4 hrs on low. Also I skipped browning the meat altogether knowing that it was going in the crock for a while..I just mixed the raw meat with the sauted onion and rice and layered it. So easy and it got the thumbs up approval from my polish mom</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Made this tonight and it was SO good! Instead of the mozza cheese, I just sprinkled 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese on top and instead of tomato sauce, I used spicy pasta sauce. The diced tomatoes I used were spicy as well. I expected the end result to be super spicy, but it wasn&#39;t &#8211; had a nice flavor though 🙂 This is going on my favorites list!! (along with all the other Skinny Taste recipes I&#39;ve made!!)

<div class="comment-content"><p>Looks like a recipe I&#39;ll have to try. My family is from Eastern Europe and I remember as a child my grandmother making stuffed cabbage rolls for us and they were so good. Unfortunately, I never got a recipe from her before she died. I was only 21 at the time, in college and didn&#39;t have my mind on those sorts of things. I found a very labor intensive one by Tyler Florence and have it book-marked but have yet to attempt it. This looks way easier. Hopefully I&#39;ll get my kids to eat it too. They&#39;re not picky but you never know. There&#39;s a 1st for everything!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Kelly, sure soy crumbles would work to make this vegetarian or even vegan. </p>
<p>To the person who asked what cabbage is, it has a distinct flavor and smell so I&#39;m sure the kids would know it&#39;s there. Try it, they might like it! You could easily make half as a test.</p>
<p>I&#39;m so glad you all liked it and loved hearing your adaptations to this, I bet all your versions were wonderful.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Gina!<br />I Have tried a couple of your recipes lately ( I will post on the others as well) and I defintely plan on trying more! <br />This casserole was truly delicious! My husband&#39;s Ukrainian Grandmother makes cabbage rolls and he loves them. I have no desire to compete with her cabbage rolls, or spend all that time making them! This was reminiscent of the tradtional dish while being incredibly simple to make!<br />I did use a little smoked paprika in addition to the sweet. Not sure how much of a difference it made, but it was delicious! <br />Thanks!<br />Lisa</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I made this for our Steelers playoff party, today. I layered a small can of sauerkraut on top. I drained,rinsed and squeezed most of the water off. Took a taste and is very yummy. My mom made her halupkis with sauerkraut in the pot. Smells just like hers did when she cooked them. Leaving the cheese on the side for the guests to decide if they want to add. Thanks for the lightened recipe, Gina! Much appreciated.</p>

<p>Sarah, you could make it without the rice but I don&#39;t think it would be as filling.</p>
<p>This recipe calls for cooked rice, not 2 cups uncooked.</p>
<p>This was 18 cups of uncooked cabbage after I shredded it.</p>
<p>Janet, you could probably layer my skinny mashed potatoes, sauerkrout and then the rest of the ingredients. It make more servings for sure.</p>
<p>Yes, you could use ground turkey instead, no rules in cooking!</p>
<p>Regular paprika would work if you don&#39;t have Hungarian.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I made this last evening for dinner. I didn&#39;t cook the rice or the cabbage first. I added the rice to the meat sauce and simmered for about 20 minutes. I did have to add a little water to keep moist. Then layered that in the dish with the chopped cabbage. I also used ground turkey. It was AWESOME! I will definitely make again. Next time I am going to use quinoa instead of rice. Can&#39;t wait!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>When I made the recipe last night I used the coleslaw to save some time. I used two bags, but I could see using two and a half. However, my cassarole was a little bit bigger because I used more than one pound of meat. I also used venison which was wonderful! Will be making this again!!!!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I already tried it &#8211; even my kids liked it.<br />And it is already bookmarked for repeats.</p>
<p>Cabbage is very healthy!<br />You can use savoy cabbage as well &#8211; it cooks much faster and its a little different from the taste.<br />Throw in some capers and you have a new version.</p>

<p>Without the cheese it won&#39;t be as pretty, but you just want to make sure it&#39;s all bubbly and hot.</p>
<p>Kalyn, tell your friend we loved it too!</p>
<p>Eleanor, I think quinoa would be great!</p>
<p>Chum, I bet that would be great. Can you believe I never had Lebanese food before, I may have to go try it!</p>
<p>Peanutbutter, that&#39;s great!</p>
<p>Thanks Deb, will have to try those crumbles someday. Great alternative for vegetarians.</p>
<p>Jackie, I like cabbage too!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Gina,<br />Another alternative to ground beef or turkey are the Boca or Morning Star(my preference) crumbles.

<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Gina,</p>
<p>This looks interesting and I can&#39;t wait to try it. I might make a little deviation, though and try an alternative version with cinnamon and a touch of allspice, instead of the paprika, etc., to give it the Lebanese cabbage roll taste (though without cheese). I often deconstruct my family&#39;s Lebanese recipes into soups or even just one-pot meals to save time when I&#39;m not preparing them for a special occasion. I am a lazy cook sometimes but crave foods I grew up with when I am homesick for family. Thanks for this and congrats on all the awards! You deserve them.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I&#39;ve made a version of this, and even my kids liked it. As a working mom, I saved a little time by using a store-bought coleslaw mix in the bag. Fresh cut is better, but when choices are coleslaw bag or drive-thru, I think my family is better with the shortcut than the drive-thru. Keep up the great work! I love the pictures and recipes!</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I have another recipe much like this. We like it better than the regular labor intensive Cabbage Rolls. I make it with ground turkey. I concur you must be a mind-reader as I was just thinking about this the other day and was wondering what a soup would be like. (Just add more canned diced tomatos or maybe some V-8?) For sure on the menu this weekend !</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Just got through eating this on the second day. Even better! The next time I am going to try making it more user friendly by stirring raw converted brown rice into the meat mixture and add a little more water. Also I will try not sauteing the cabbage before hand but putting it raw into the casserole dish. It may have to cook for a little while longer but I would save a pan. I did add pepper flakes to the sauce which I do with all tomato sauces. Traditional cabbage rolls do not have cheese and I think this would be good without it and you would save calories or I would replace the cheese with more meat. If you really want to simplify, you could use a store bought marinara sauce and add more garlic, thyme and smoked paprika.</p>
